# Influence-Maximization-project
All files relating to my individual project on influence maximization:
1. Python program files - cascade_final.py, network_analysis_final.py, seed_selection_final.py & upgrades.py (not required to replicate this project, stores various builds and testing code)
2. Source code .txt file
3. Dataset files - soc-sign-bitcoinotc.csv & facebook.csv
4. Seed selection results Excel spreadsheet
5. Latex algorithms source code .txt file
6. Latex algorithms .pdf file
7. Final written report word doc

Guide:
1. Install all program files , and the dataset files soc-sign-bitcoinotc.csv & facebook.csv.
2. Manually edit the 'datasets' dictionary near the top of the page in cascade_final.py and change the path names to whatever their path names are now (this is described in Appendix B).
3. Run cascade_final
4. Run network_analysis_final
5. Run seed_selection_final
(Running these 3 programs may take some time due to simulations with many iterations, you can manually decrease the number of iterations if necessary).
