# Influence-Maximization-project
All files relating to my individual project on influence maximization

Guide:
1. Install all files, including the dataset files - bitcoin_otc & facebook (upgrades.py is not required to replicate this project, but merely stores various builds and testing).
2. Manually edit the 'datasets' dictionary near the top of the page in cascade_final.py and change the path names to whatever their path names are now (this is described in Appendix B).
3. Run cascade_final
4. Run network_analysis_final
5. Run seed_selection_final
(Running these 3 programs may take some time due to simulations with many iterations, you can manually decrease the number of iterations if necessary).
